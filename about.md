I am a biochemist by education, molecular biologist and jack-of-all-trades by work experience.  I have always maintained a love for education, math and science!  I found my love for molecular biology lab work when I began working in labs at the local University, but quickly realized that the cold, white, sterile environment necessary to conduct good research was not where my passion lied, but in the research, troubleshooting, and problem solving aspects of the jobs.  My brother is by trade and education a computer science guru, and I have envied his jobs for many years now.
