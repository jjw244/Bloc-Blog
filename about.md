I am a biochemist by education, molecular biologist and jack-of-all-trades by work experience.  I have always maintained a love for education, math and science.  I found my love for molecular biology lab work when I began working in labs at the local University, but quickly realized that the cold, white, sterile environment necessary to conduct good research was not where my passion lied, but in the research, troubleshooting, and problem solving aspects of the positions.  I tried administration mostly because the money was better, and quickly realized the slow, simplicity (no real intellectual stimulation) was not how I wanted to spend the rest of my working career. My favorite work experience was being a contract Rock Climbing Guide for several years, I really enjoy teaching or sharing knowledge, and I like seeing people succeed at things they put their minds to.  

I was in search of a career change something that I enjoyed doing, that paid well (I live in an expensive cityâ€¦..Austin, Tx), in an industry that was growing and was yet to be saturated with people.  I decided to look into what it would take to be a software developer, and found 4-year college degree plans and online coding boot camps.  I already have a BSc. and just wanted to add to my education, so I decided to look into online boot camps.  This way I could couple my biochemist background and new software developer skills to work in data science.  Ultimately I want to be able to work remotely, as I like spending time outside and most offices are indoors
